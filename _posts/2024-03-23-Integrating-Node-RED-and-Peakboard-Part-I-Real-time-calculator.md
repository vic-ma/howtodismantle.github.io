In this two-part article series, we discuss some best practices for integrating Peakboard with Node-RED applications.

Most of the time, communication between Node-RED and the outside world happens through MQTT or HTTP. We will use the HTTP option:

How to send information from Peakboard to Node-RED, do something with it, and then process the result in real-time.

How to send an alert from a Node-RED flow and visualize it in a Peakboard application.

## Goals for this article

In this article, we build a Peakboard application that does the following:
1. Take in two numbers from the user.
2. Submit the two numbers to a Node-RED flow, which will add the numbers and return the sum.

The purpose of this exercise is to understand how to use Peakboard to submit and receive information from Node-RED.

## Building the Node-RED flow

The following screenshot shows the flow we're using. Here's what the flow does:
1. An `HTTP In` node receives the call.
2. A Function node adds the two numbers from the JSON payload of the call.
3. A Template node creates the response.
4. An `HTTP Response` node returns the response to the caller.

We also add Debug nodes so that we can follow the flow in the debug window, when it's executed.

The `HTTP In` node listens at the `/Add` URL:

The Function node adds the two numbers, `X` and `Y`. It creates a third attribute in the payload, `result`, to hold the result:

The actual response is created with a Template node. It's a simple JSON object which has a `Result` property that points to the result we created in the last step:

The `HTTP Response` node doesn't need any additional configuration. It simply returns the payload to the caller:

## Building the Peakboard app

The Peakboard app is super simple. There are two text fields for the input, a button that sends the request, and a text field for the output. We also make sure to give the text fields proper names, so we can use them in scripting.

The actual script consists of two steps:

1. Call the HTTP endpoint of the Node-RED flow.
2. Concatenate the strings to build a proper JSON object with the two numbers from the text fields, `X` and `Y`.

Here's what the JSON looks like:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "X": 36,
    "Y": 42
}
{% endhighlight %}

We also set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`. Otherwise, the flow won't know that we're sending a JSON object.

The call returns the JSON response. Here's what it looks like:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "Result": 78
}
{% endhighlight %}

To extract the result from the response, we use a JSON path block, and address the `Result` attribute. The value is put into the text field we prepared earlier.

## Conclusion

Here's the application in action, along with the debug window in Node-RED:
