Since its official release in 2022, Peakboard Hub has become more and more popular among customers. Initially, it was only designed to be an administration interface for environments with 20+ boxes. Since then, many API endpoints have been added, and there's also a SaaS offering for customers who don't want to host their Hub on premises.

At the end of the 2024, Peakboard introduced an official API for Peakboard Hub. This API lets you connect Peakboard Hub to countless other systems, especially in the cloud. Today, we'll kick off a new series of articles that show what you can do with the API and how to integrate it.

## The API key

The first thing we need is a Peakboard Hub API key.
An API key is related to a user group, so a key can only access the lists, boxes, alerts, etc. that are available to the corresponding user group.

To add a new API key, we go to the user groups of an organization and look for the key list. Then, we click **Add**.

We define the scope of the key (e.g. restricted to only reading lists), along with the expiration period. Although it's possible to generate a key that never expires, it's best practice to have an expiration date and renew the key on a regular basis.

After creating the new key, we copy it.

## Authentication

Before we can make our first API call, we must turn our API key into an access token. To do that, we use the public API endpoint `/public-api/v1/auth/token`.

It requires us to submit our API key in the header of the request. If successful, it returns a JSON string that contains an `accessToken` that we can use later.

The following code demonstrates the authentication process in C#. Feel free to download the whole [CS file](/assets/2024-11-17/PeakboardHubAPIPart1.cs) for this example. We use the NuGet package Newtonsoft.Json to perform the JSON operations.

{% highlight cs %}
lusing Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;

const string BaseURL = "http://hub.peakboard.com";
const string APIKey = "XXX";

using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
{
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("apiKey",APIKey);
HttpResponseMessage response = client.GetAsync(BaseURL + "/public-api/v1/auth/token").Result;
var responseBody = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;
if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
{
var rawdata = JObject.Parse(responseBody);
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Authorization", "Bearer " + rawdata["accessToken"]?.ToString());
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Remove("apiKey");
Console.WriteLine("Access Token succesfully received " + rawdata["accessToken"]?.ToString());
}
else {
Console.WriteLine("Error during authentification");
Console.WriteLine(responseBody.ToString());
return;
}

    // Do something useful and call a real API

    Console.WriteLine("Finished, yay!");

}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's how the script works:

1. Call the `auth/token` endpoint, with the key in the header.
1. Get the token from the response.
1. Put the token in the header for future calls. Remove the API key from the header for future calls, because we only needed it for the `auth/token` endpoint.

After this sequence, the `HttpClient` object is ready to be used with any API call that is within the scope of the API key.

## Actual API call

For the actual API call, we reuse the client object. In the following example, we list all boxes that are registered in the Hub by calling the `/public-api/v1/box` endpoint. We then loop over the deserialized JSON string.

{% highlight cs %}
response = client.GetAsync(BaseURL + "/public-api/v1/box").Result;
responseBody = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;

    if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        JArray rawlist = JArray.Parse(responseBody);
        Console.WriteLine($"Found {rawlist.Count} boxes");
        foreach(var row in rawlist)
            Console.WriteLine($"{row["name"]} - {row["boxID"]} - {row["runtimeVersion"]} - {row["state"]}");
    }
    else
        Console.WriteLine("Error during call -> " + response.StatusCode + response.ReasonPhrase);

{% endhighlight %}

The console output should look like this. We note that all boxes except one are offline.

## List of Hub API endpoints

Here's a list of endpoints that are currently available in version 1 of the Peakboard Hub API. We go through all these endpoints in various articles.
