Peakboard has become the ultimate data visualization solution for industrial workplaces. Peakboard connects to a wide variety of data sources and offers fast and simple application development. But until now, not many individual users have used the Peakboard platform---because its price point was higher than free alternatives like Node-RED or Grafana.

This changed forever in the summer of 2025, when the company introduced its new **Community License**. In this article, we’ll cover all the key points about the Community License and provide a complete guide for downloading and installing everything you need to get started.

## Community License Coverage

As of summer 2025, here’s what the Community License includes:

- Unlimited use of the Peakboard Designer (we already had this before the CE)
- Unlimited use of BYOD/runtime installations — as long as it's for **non-commercial** use
- Non-commercial means: private use at home, in educational settings like schools or universities, and for charitable or NGO organizations
- All data sources are available, including support for extensions
- All known features are included

However, there are some important limitations:

- **Any** use within a company counts as commercial use and is not covered (including test systems or backup setups)
- Use of the **on-premises Peakboard Hub** is not included
- The **support and ticket system** is not available for non-paying users
- In the future, there may be features that are not part of the CE. Until then, the Community Edition includes the full feature set of the commercial Enterprise License

## Support

As company support services are not included in the license, community users can rely on [the Peakboard Reddit forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/Peakboard/). Questions and issues are often resolved quickly by the community — and we regularly see Peakboard engineers joining the discussion and helping out as well.
