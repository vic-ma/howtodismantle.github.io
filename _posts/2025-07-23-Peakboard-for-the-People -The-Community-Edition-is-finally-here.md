Peakboard has become the ultimate data visualization solution for industrial workplaces. Peakboard connects to a wide variety of data sources and offers fast and simple application development. But until now, not many individual users have used the Peakboard platform---because its price point was higher than free alternatives like Node-RED or Grafana.

This changed forever in the summer of 2025, when the company launched the [**Peakboard Community Edition**](https://www.peakboard.com/en/community-edition), which gives private and non-commercial users a free license for the [Peakboard BYOD runtime](https://www.peakboard.com/en/product/peakboard-byod). In this article, we’ll cover everything you need to know about the Community Edition and provide a complete guide for downloading and installing everything you need to get started.


## Community License Coverage

As of summer 2025, here’s what the Community License includes:

- Unlimited use of Peakboard Designer (this was always the case, even before the Community Edition).
- Unlimited use of BYOD/runtime installations, as long as it's for **non-commercial** use.
- All data sources, including extensions.
- All available features.

Note that **any** use within a company counts as commercial use and is not covered under the community license (including usage in test systems or backup setups).

Here are some examples of non-commercial use:
* Private usage at home.
* Usage in educational settings like schools and universities.
* Usage in charitable organizations and non-profit NGOs.

Finally, there are some important limitations to the Community Edition:
- Use of the **on-premises Peakboard Hub** is not available.
- The **support and ticket system** is not available.
- In the future, there may be features that are not part of the Community Edition. But currently, the Community Edition includes all the features that are available in the Enterprise Edition.


## Support

Because official support is not included in the Community Edition, community users can use the [Peakboard subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Peakboard/). Questions and issues are often resolved quickly by members of the community---and we regularly see Peakboard engineers joining the discussions and helping out too.
