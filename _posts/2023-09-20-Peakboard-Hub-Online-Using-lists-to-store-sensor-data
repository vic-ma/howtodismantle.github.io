In this article, we will learn how to write sensor data to a list in Peakboard Hub Online (PBHO). We will also learn how to read from a list. Finally, we will learn how to use a SQL command when reading from a list, in order to aggregate data.

What sensor data will we use? We will use the data from an air conditioner, which comes from a public OPC UA server. See [this article](/OPC-UA-Basics-Getting-started-with-a-public-OPC-UA-server.html) to learn the basics of reading from an OPC UA server in Peakboard.

## Creating a data source for our sensor data

 We create a new OPC UA data source for our sensor data. 

We subscribe to these three nodes:
* `Temperature`, the current ambient temperature
* `PowerConsumption`, the current power consumption
* `Quality`, the current air quality (I am unsure, but let's just assume this represents air quality)

Finally, we change the polling rate to 5 seconds, to slow it down a bit.
