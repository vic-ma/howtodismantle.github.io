One the most important jobs of a Peakboard application is to communicate with the outside world. In today's article, we'll take a look at the [seven API](https://www.seven.io/en/products/sms-gateway-api/), a business messaging gateway service that makes it easy for businesses to send and receive SMS.

First, we'll explain how the seven API works. Then, we'll build a small Peakboard application that sends out an SMS message to a phone number. Seven also offers an [email-to-SMS service](https://www.seven.io/en/products/email-to-sms/) for those that don't want to use the API.

## The seven portal

You can create a free account in the seven portal. This lets you test out the API  without paying any money. Inside the portal, you can also select a payment plan. You can also change the configuration, in order to set up how incoming SMS messages are processed.

For our example, we create an API key that covers the `SMS` scope:

## The UI

For our Peakboard app, we first create a simple UI with two text fields and a button:

## The API

For our example, we use the [legacy method of seven's SMS endpoint](https://docs.seven.io/en/rest-api/endpoints/sms#legacy).

We send a `GET` request to the `api/sms/` endpoint, and we use query parameters to specify the SMS message we want to send:

{% highlight url %}
https://gateway.seven.io/api/sms?to=#[to]#&from=#[from]#&text=#[text]#
{% endhighlight %}

| Query parameter | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| `to`            | The phone number that receives the SMS message.
| `from`          | The sender's phone number, or the sender's name.
| `text`          | The contents of the SMS message.

We also submit the API key in a header called `X-Api-Key`, in order to authenticate ourselves.

In the Peakboard Building Blocks, we use use a text placeholder block to build the correct URL, including all the query parameters:

For our application, we don't evaluate the response from the API. All we do is write it into the log. The API returns a code that lets us know if the call was a success or failure. For more information, check out the [SMS endpoint return codes](https://docs.seven.io/en/rest-api/endpoints/sms#return-codes).

To learn more about the seven API in general, check out the [seven API documentation](https://docs.seven.io/en).

## Result

The following screenshot shows the incoming SMS sent by our application, via seven:

This was a very basic example. There is much more cool stuff you can do with seven. Here are some ideas:

- The seven API works in all Hub Flows. So, it might make sense to handle seven API calls in a central Hub Flow, rather than an individual Peakboard application.
- You can use the seven API to receive SMS messages and process them in a Peakboard application or a Hub Flow.
- The seven API can also send [voice calls](https://docs.seven.io/en/rest-api/endpoints/voice#send-voice-call). Imagine a machine calling the supervisor to explain the details of an issue. How cool is that! The voice message API call is as easy to build as the SMS message call we looked at today.
