Peakboard is designed for applications to run entirely on one physical screen, preferably a touchscreen. This is how a typical Peakboard-backed industrial application operates. However, there may be times when you need to capture or share the screen — or parts of it — beyond the current display. Common use cases include notifying someone via email or archiving the current status of a chart for review the next day, such as in shop floor management processes. In this article, we will explore how to generate a screenshot from your current visualization and perform actions with it—whether storing, sending, or pushing it to an API endpoint.

## Preparing the UI Elements

The foundation for our example is one of the official templates: [Your dashboard for strategic warehouse management](https://templates.peakboard.com/Strategic-Logistics-Board/en). You can download the modified version for this article [here](/assets/2026-03-11/ScreenshotDemo.pbmx). We made a few small adjustments to demonstrate the power of screenshotting. Let's examine the tile in the middle of the upper section of the dashboard, which displays complaint reasons. From a UI perspective, it consists of a chart and several text boxes that form the chart legend and captions. All these elements are grouped into a single container called `ComplaintReasonGroup`. Typically, groups are used to organize controls on the screen for locking or hiding/showing them collectively. We can leverage this group for our screenshot later. Additionally, we need a printer icon to trigger the screenshot.

## Light - Camera - Action

Let's examine the code behind the button. On the right side, in the tree of screen elements, you'll find blocks for handling screen groups. We're using the `Send Screenshot via Email` block to compose and send an email. The screenshot is embedded in the email body along with the provided text.

Here's the final result of the sent email.

## What to Do with a Screenshot

As shown in the screenshot above, there are several options for processing screenshots:

- Send the screenshot via email, either in the body or as an attachment.
- Store the screenshot in the file management system of the Peakboard Hub.
- Store the screenshot in a SharePoint document library or on OneDrive.
- Convert the screenshot to a Base64 string, which is useful for submitting to an API endpoint or triggering workflows in external tools.
