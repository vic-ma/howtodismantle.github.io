Table controls are the most commonly used controls for displaying table data. However, we often see that designers do not use table controls to their full potential. Table controls can present data in a way that lets the end user find what they are looking for as quickly as possible. This article covers the best practices for modifying a table row on the fly and adjusting it to the content. In our example, we use a list of outbound deliveries. Here's how we want to modify the data in the table:

1. When the `Priority` column of an outbound delivery is set to `High`, the row should have a red background color.

2. When the weight of a delivery is more than 3 kg, we want to place a biceps icon next to value, to advise the end user that this delivery is especially heavy.

## Preparing the data

This example is based on a simple CSV data file. It's included in the project file, and it shows a couple of outbound deliveries, including the recipient's name, weight of the delivery, priority etc.

To make it easier to handle the data later, we add a dataflow to the data source. As seen in the screenshot, we change the data type for the `Weight` and `NumberOfPackages` columns to `Number`. We have to do this manually, because the data comes from a CSV file, and every column of a CSV file is treated as a string by default.

## Setting up the table control

To add our table control, we drag and drop the data flow onto the canvas, and then choose a table control. To make it a bit nicer, we adjust the column labels, column width, and title of the control.

The most important part is the *Datarow loaded event*. It's triggered every time a row is painted onto the canvas during runtime. Let's assume our dataset has 10 rows. Then, the event is fired 10 times, once for each data row.

All the manipulation can be done within this event. The manipulation can change attributes like the cell color or even to the data values that are displayed. Let's learn more about these manipulations.

Within the event editor, there are several blocks we can use for the *Datarow loaded event*. Let's assume we want to know the content of the `Priority` column of the data row that is currently being painted. Then, we just use the block *Row value*.

This script shows how you can get the value of a column and use it in an if statement. It checks if the priority of the delivery is high, and if so, it changes the background color to red.

This script shows how you can manipulate the data that's displayed in a cell. In this case, we check if the weight column content is greater than 3 kg. If so, we add a Unicode character representing the flexed biceps muscle: ðŸ’ª.

In Peakboard, these Unicode characters are always monochrome. Please note: We are manipulating the contents of the cell in the table, and not the actual data. That's why we use the *Set table cell* block to paint our adjusted content.

Here's the final result, which shows the red priority rows and the muscle icon:

## Conclusion

This article shows how easy it is to manipulate the output of a table control with just a few clicks. But sometimes, more complex adjustments are needed, and the table control doesn't provide the capabilities to do so. In this case it's better to use a "Styled list" control and have an individual design for each row.
