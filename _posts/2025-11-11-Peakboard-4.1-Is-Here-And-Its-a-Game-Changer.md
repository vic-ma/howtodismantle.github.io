The long-awaited [Peakboard version
4.1](https://help.peakboard.com/misc/en-version-history.html) is finally here
(released in October 2025)! It has the most amount of bug fixes and improvements
out of any update so far. But more importantly, it comes with five big new
features:
1. BACnet data source
1. Peakbot AI
1. Hub files data source
1. Drawing area
1. Debug panel

Let's take a look at how these work now!


## BACnet data source

BACnet (Building Automation and Control Network) is an open communication
protocol designed for building automation systems. It enables devices from
different manufacturers to communicate with one another and work together (e.g.
HVAC controllers, lighting systems, access control, sensors).

It does this by
defining a standard for messages and data structures that can be transferred
over a network. BACnet is widely used in large buildings, factories, and smart
infrastructures, to provide centralized monitoring and control for energy
systems.

A new feature in Peakboard 4.1 is the BACnet data source. The data source acts as a BACnet client and communicates with the servers and devices. It can read from and write to the connected devices.

We'll discuss more about this new data source in an upcoming article:
[Peakboard Meets BACnet – Your First Steps into Building
Automation](/Peakboard-Meets-BACnet-Your-First-Steps-into-Building-Automation.html).

## Peakbot AI

Peakbot AI is the brand new AI chatbot that's integrated directly into Peakboard
Designer! It's similar to GitHub Copilot. You can use it to help build your
application's Building Blocks scripts.

To use Peakbot AI, open a Building Blocks script and click on the Peakbot AI
icon. Then, use natural language to communicate with Peakbot and it'll generate
Building Blocks and automatically add the mto your script.

### Example
Let's try it out. We'll ask the AI to generate a script that processes the data
from an Office 365 calendar data source and displays the newest timestamp on
screen. Here's our prompt:

```
Please use the calendar data source and iterate through the data. 
Check the timestamp and then write the newest timestamp to
the text field on the screen.
```

And here's the result!

## Hub files data source

The Hub files data source lets you pull any of the files that you have stored in
Peakboard Hub. This might sound boring at first, but there's actually a lot of
cool things you can do with it!

We'll discuss more about this data source in an upcoming article: [From Folder
to Fame – How Hub Files Became a Dynamic
Infoboard](/From-Folder-to-Fame-How-Hub-Files-Became-a-Dynamic-Infoboard.html).
We'll build an info-board that lets the user look at all the PDF files stored in Peakboard Hub.

## Drawing area

More and more users build applications on tablets that need someone to sign with
their fingers—these could be audits or other activities that need clear
confirmation and acknowledgement from the end user. With the new drawing area
control this can be built just by using drag and drop while building the
application. The drawing area can also be used to let the user scribble ideas or
simple drawings.

We will discuss the drawing area control in detail in one of the articles early
next year: [Draw, Sign, Approve – A New Interactive Drawing Area for
Peakboard](/Draw-Sign-Approve-A-New-Interactive-Drawing-Area-for-Peakboard.html)

## Debug panel

Peakboard developers have waited for this for years. Let's assume we have a very
complex project and need to better understand how the data structures evolve in
the running project. So far, we often used table controls or log files to get an
idea of what is happening on the data side. With the new debug panel these days
are over. We can follow any data structure in real time and even call functions
on the fly or reload data sources and flows manually—a real game changer for any
advanced developer.

By the way, we will dive deep into the topic of advanced debugging patterns in
one of the future articles in February next year: [The Log Files Strike Back – A
Nerd’s Guide to Peakboard
Debugging](/The-Log-Files-Strike-Back-A-Nerds-Guide-to-Peakboard-Debugging.html)
