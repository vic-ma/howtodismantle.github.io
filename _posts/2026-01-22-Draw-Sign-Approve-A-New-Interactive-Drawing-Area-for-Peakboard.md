With the release of [Peakboard version 4.1](/Peakboard-4.1-Is-Here-And-Its-a-Game-Changer.html), we now have access to a new visual control: the **drawing area.** This control lets end users draw on a touchscreen device, by using a finger or stylus.

This control can be used for signatures, sketches, or other drawing-based tasks. The signature use case is likely the most common. Some readers may remember the [audit use case](/Digital-Walkaround-Inspections-Part-I-How-to-Build-an-Audit-App.html), which would be a perfect fit for using the drawing area to let users sign the final results of the audit.

## The Drawing Area Control

The control comes with several settings. End users can choose the color and thickness of the drawing line using built-in buttons. There is also a button for clearing the area and activating or deactivating the drawing process. Whether to show or hide these options to the end user can be defined through the corresponding property.

In our example, we will hide all these buttons and offer the end user only a black drawing line for their signature.

## Preparing the Screen

For our example, we assume the user needs to sign an order. The order number is stored in a variable. To process the signature, we must place the drawing area control into a group and name the group `SignGroup`.

## Processing the Drawing

To process a drawing, we use a universal function. Peakboard offers several Building Blocks to process the screenshot of a group. Our group `SignGroup` consists of only one control: the drawing area control. For uploading the signature, we use the Peakboard Hub file system to store it. However, we could also choose different destinations like SharePoint or email (see the right area of the screenshot). If necessary, we can pass the signature to an external, generic API using Base64 encoding to submit the image for processing.

In our example, the signature is stored with a timestamp and the order number in the filename in a dedicated Hub file system folder. Then, the area is cleared for the next signature.

## Result

For our test, we sign the order...

... and check the Peakboard Hub filesystem to confirm the signature is stored successfully.
